        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          At some point, we’ve all experienced the stress of losing something important.
          What if there were a smarter, simpler way to get it back — one that brings people together in the process?
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to our intelligent <strong>Lost & Found solution</strong>, designed for the MMU community.
          Using <strong>dynamic QR codes</strong>, we help you protect and recover your belongings —
          efficiently, securely, and with a touch of innovation.
        </p>
      
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Generate a unique QR code and print it in any size you prefer</li>
          <li>Track total scans, time, and date of each scan</li>
          <li>Monitor your item’s scan history in real-time</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Share with Trust</h3>
        <p>
          You can safely share tracking access with trusted individuals.
          This collaborative feature helps others assist you while keeping your privacy intact.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Campus-Centric Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          Tracking is limited to the <strong>MMU campus</strong> for accuracy and safety.
          Scans appear on a real-time campus map so you always know the latest location.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Reward Those Who Help</h3>
        <p>
          Users can create a <strong>commission</strong> when reporting a lost item.
          Once the item is found, the commission can be closed — turning support into success.
        </p>
      
        <h3>When an Item is Found</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The finder can return it directly</li>
          <li>Or share the item’s location for pickup</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Enhancing Every Detail</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Upload a photo for easy recognition</li>
          <li>Add notes or descriptions to identify the item</li>
          <li>Get instant notifications when your QR code is scanned</li>
          <li>Browse the public “Found Items” list</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Built for MMU — Powered by Community</h3>
        <p>
          More than a tool — this is a trusted network of students and staff working together.
          We make finding what’s lost faster, easier, and more meaningful.
        </p>
        <p><em>Because sometimes, it takes a village — or just one good scan.</em></p>
